Mission to automate data collection using AWS, Python

✅ Automated Web Scraping — Your Python script automatically fetches quotes from APIs, eliminating manual data collection.

✅ Cloud-Based Storage — Instead of storing data locally, you’re using AWS RDS (a managed MySQL database), ensuring scalability and reliability.

✅ EC2 for Compute Automation — Your script runs on an AWS EC2 instance, which automates data processing in the cloud.

✅ Integration of Cloud Services — You’ve set up IAM permissions, RDS for storage, and EC2 for execution, creating an automated cloud pipeline.
